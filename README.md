# docker-ship
Boots docker instances based on a JSON config file.

# Warning.
This is very very Alpha stage. Be warned.

# Usage
`python docker-ship.py filename.json`

See the provided `sample.json` file for now. 
it mimics the linking tutorial at: https://docs.docker.com/userguide/dockerlinks/

If you run it more than once it wont take down any name conflicts, that's your responsibility for now.

More docs will come. :)
